[tsp_algorithms](https://github.com/pnuie/tsp_algorithms)
Comparative study of various algorithms (Greedy, 2-opt, LNS, etc.) for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

[tsp_GA](https://github.com/pnuie/tsp_GA)
Object-oriented implementation of Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve TSP, with future extensions planned for neural approaches like Pointer Networks.

[column_generation](https://github.com/pnuie/column_generation)
Column Generation method applied to the Cutting Stock Problem (CSP), focusing on linear programming formulations.

[branch_and_bound](https://github.com/pnuie/branch_and_bound)
Custom Branch and Bound (B&B) implementation for small Integer Programming (IP) problems, with variations in node exploration strategies.
